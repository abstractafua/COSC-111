# COSC-111

 Features:
  - We have from 1 to 3 players
  - We have many questions grouped in 3 categories . Each player chooses a category before being asked. 
  - Each player may be asked more than one question from different categories. 
  - User can play many rounds of the game. 
 
 Focus: 
 	- 2-D arrays 
 
 Aim:
 	- Build more complex programs that involves the use of 2-D arrays

 REQ (for bonus marks):
 You should build on your code from part P4 and satisfy the following requirements:
   1.  Create three categories of questions in a 2D array (rows=categories, col=questions). 
        in each player's turn, ask the player about the required category and then ask a question from that category.
        make all necessary changes to your program (e.g. shuffle method should now work for 2D array)
   2.  If we are out of questions in a category (i.e., all questions in this category were offered and answered correctly), inform the player to choose another category.
